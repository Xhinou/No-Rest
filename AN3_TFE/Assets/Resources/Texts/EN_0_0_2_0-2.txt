<i>???</i>: Waw! Here's come the king!
That was nice! I'm very proud of you right now!
This "Arthur" was such a jerk. He deserved that chalice in the face! Ah ah!
And this useless wizard... I laughed so hard! But it was worth to save him.
Anyway, your choices were nice, but some things still need to be changed!
Do you want to keep going or are we ok for now?
Argh! Again you failed!
Seriously, can't you make right choices?! It is exhausting!
You will never reach the World Above the Others if you act greedily every time.
Well, well, well. Back in life! And do not disappoint me again PLEASE!
