Greedy Jackie: Hey Captain! Have you found a pickaxe?
Greedy Jackie: HAVE YOU FOUND a pickaxe???
Greedy Jackie: But seriously, stop talking to me!
Go find a pickaxe or finish the level, dude!
Greedy Jackie: Perfect, Captain! So... I don't have a pickaxe but you can get the gold!
Just mine it on the gold seams right there.
See you later, eh? I'll be around if you look for me.
