<i>Greedy Jackie</i>: HAVE YOU FOUND a pickaxe???
<i>Greedy Jackie</i>: But seriously, stop talking to me!
Go find a pickaxe or finish the level, dude!
<i>Greedy Jackie</i>: Perfect, Captain! So... I don't have a pickaxe but you can get the gold!
Just mine it on the gold seams right there.
See you later, eh? I'll be around if you look for me.
