<i>Sailormun</i>: This is quite a nice place. And look at those tiny huts. And this lovely people.
I bet that they can't even read a treaty, ah ah!
<i>Chiefaak'ab</i>: Welcome, travelers. What brings you here on our ancestral lands by this Mooooon season?
<i>Sailormun</i>: Captain! You're so late! We don't have much time to sign the treaty so please talk quickly to the chief!
<i>Chiefaak'ab</i>: I'm sorry that I can't talk with you right now, but I'm quite busy with the Mooooon Ceremony.
Meet me at the Great Shrine where we could discuss.
