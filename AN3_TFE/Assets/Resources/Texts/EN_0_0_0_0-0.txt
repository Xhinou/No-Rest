Oh... it is you... again.
It looks like you still have failed to be a good person.
Everytime I send you in a new corpse you are just messing up everything !

Are you ready to incarnate? I know it hurts but you cannot avoid it.
And also, this time I will try to put you in an understandable position.
Be ready! It happens in...
