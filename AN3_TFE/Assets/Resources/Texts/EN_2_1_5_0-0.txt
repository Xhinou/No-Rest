<i>Preparaktun</i>: Hey! Look at this one! He's the captain! He committed the murdering of our chief!
Take him to the Mooooon Ceremony!
<i>Sailormun</i>: Oh Captain, why?! We were so close to sign the treaty
when an insane 'weirdo' suddenly appeared from nowhere and killed the chief!
He told us that you agreed with this, so you could take the gold! I-am-sooo disappointed.
<i>Preparaktun</i>: I SAID: To the Mooooon Ceremony!
<i>Sailormun</i>: This way captain, I hope you'll be ok.
