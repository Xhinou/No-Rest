<i>Chief</i>: So, now that you are here, I have to tell you that you will be the first traveler
who participate to this important ceremony.
<i>Native</i>: The Mooooon Ceremony!
<i>Chief</i>: Please lie down on the Great Shrine and we will proceed to your rising.
<i>Sailor</i>: Seems a fair trade. Do it, Captain! And make us rich!
<i>Sailor</i>: Hey Captain! While you were away I've signed the treaty. You weren't there so I've
modified it a bit to get some advantages for myself, you won't be mad at me, would you?
<i>Chief</i>: The Mooooon Ceremony!
<i>Sailor</i>: Oh yes, also those people want you to participate to the Moon Ceremony and-
<i>Chief</i>: Mooooon!
<i>Sailor</i>: *um* the Mooooon Ceremony?
<i>Chief</i>: :'D
<i>Sailor</i>: Well just do this and we'll get our gold, see you later!
