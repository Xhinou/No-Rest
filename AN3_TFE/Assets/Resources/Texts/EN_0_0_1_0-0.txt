<i>???</i>: So, I have seen your trip on this kind of island and...
You did it pretty good! I expected that you would finally understand how it should be.
I found that those natives were really heartful, even if they used you as a sacrifice for their "god".
I mean -between us- there is no such thing as another "God" right? Ah ah!
Well, I am glad that you made the right choices, but your trip is not over yet.
And about this, here is the next part of your story!
What was that?! You did so bad on it!
Those natives were really heartful, but you did not give them back good.
Ok maybe they have sacrified you, but the thing is your choices were bad!
Who do you think you are? Some kind of guy playing a game and doing what he wants?!
It is not working like this, you must look further than the simple given way.
Let us try in another world! You are leaving right now and this time: do it right!
