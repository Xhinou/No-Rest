<i>Merryn the wizard</i>: Finally you came here, stranger!
Fun fact: I could have teleported here since the beginning! I don't know why I thought I was in danger.
Anyway, I know everything about you and your quest. Here is the Old Cathedral were remains what you seek.
<i>Arthur</i>: The Graal! I am now certain he is in there!
<i>Merryn the wizard</i>: The doors are locked by ancient sorcery, but I know how to ward it off! You will thank me later.
Step back! I am casting dangerous magic here!
...
"Mellon"!
...
It was supposed to work! I swear!
<i>Arthur</i>: Useless sorcerer! There might be another way to unlock this door!
