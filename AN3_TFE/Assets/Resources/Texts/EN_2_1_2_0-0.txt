<i>Sailormun</i>: Please pick up something, Captain!
I'll stand right here blocking this way for no reason while you do your stuff.
<i>Sailormun</i>: Damn Captain you're not very sma...I mean it'll be fine with this, let's go to the village!
<i>Sailormun</i>: How cute! Will it be added to your collection?
It'll be enough to sign the treaty, we don't need paper for this fake crap. Now let's go, this way!
<i>Sailormun</i>: That's my boy! Now let's go, the village's this way. I'll wait you there, so enjoy visiting the island!
