Sailor: This is quite a nice place. And look at those tiny huts. And this lovely people.
I bet that they can't even read a treaty, ah ah!
Chief: Welcome, travelers. What brings you here on our ancestral lands by this Mooooon season?
Sailor: Captain! You're so late! We don't have much time to sign the treaty so please talk quickly to the chief!
Chief: I'm sorry that I can't talk with you right now, but I'm quite busy with the Mooooon Ceremony.
Meet me at the Great Shrine where we could discuss.
Sailor: Hey Captain! While you were away I've signed the treaty. You weren't there so I've
modified it a bit to get some advantages for myself, you won't be mad at me, would you?
Chief: The Mooooon Ceremony!
Sailor: Oh yes, also those people want you to participate to the Moon Ceremony and-
Chief: Mooooon!
Sailor: *hum* the Mooooon Ceremony?
Chief: :'D
Sailor: Well just do this and we'll get our gold, see you later!
